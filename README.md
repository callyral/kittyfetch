# kittyfetch

a fetch tool inspired by ufetch, written in python. it even has an ascii cat!

## installation

install `termcolor` and `distro`, either with pip or your package manager.

to have `kittyfetch` as a command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/callyral/kittyfetch
cd kittyfetch
sudo mv kittyfetch /usr/local/bin/
```

## usage

configuration is in the script, you must edit it.

i plan on adding uptime, de/wm detection and a config file.

## note

this entire tool is WIP, including the README. i do not know python and learned more while writing the script.
